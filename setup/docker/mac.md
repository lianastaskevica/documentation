# Mac local setup (using docker)

Mac platform is currently not supported. If you happened to run the project localy on Windows platform, please tell us about it in [community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/scandipwa/shared_invite/enQtNzE2Mjg1Nzg3MTg5LTQwM2E2NmQ0NmQ2MzliMjVjYjQ1MTFiYWU5ODAyYTYyMGQzNWM3MDhkYzkyZGMxYTJlZWI1N2ExY2Q1MDMwMTk) or open an issue on GitHub. We would love to update these instructions!

> **Note**: there is ongoing development to make our setup work reliably with this platform. Track the Mutagen pull-request [here](https://github.com/scandipwa/scandipwa-base/pull/63).
