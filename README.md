# ScandiPWA Documentation

ScandiPWA is a single page application (SPA) theme for Magento with advanced PWA capabilities.

ScandiPWA is based on React and utilizes GraphQL API of Magento 2.3. The problem which our solution solves in Magento and the motivation behind the chosen technologies can be found in the [introduction to ScnadiPWA Technology Stack](./introduction.md).

Implementing the SPA is challanging. There are multiple limitations which must be addressed when going for CSR. Find out more about [SPA application challenges](./challenges.md).

Our solution is not the only one providing the SPA experience in the Magento ecosystem. To understand the main differences between the existing solutions, refer to [How we are different?](./existing_solutions.md) section of the documentation.
